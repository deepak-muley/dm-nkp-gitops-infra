# Test: Allowed Repos Policy Violation
# Policy: allowed-repos / restrict-image-registries (Gatekeeper & Kyverno)
#
# This test resource violates the policy by using an image from a disallowed registry.
# Expected behavior:
#   - Gatekeeper: Should create violation (if enforcementAction: deny, will block)
#   - Kyverno: Should create violation (if validationFailureAction: Enforce, will block)
#
# To verify violations:
#   Gatekeeper: kubectl get k8srequiredlabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh allowed-repos -o yaml
#   Kyverno: kubectl get clusterpolicy restrict-image-registries -o yaml
#
# NOTE: This test uses a fake registry. Adjust the image name based on your policy configuration.
# Common allowed registries: docker.io, gcr.io, quay.io, registry.k8s.io

    # VIOLATION: Using image from disallowed registry (adjust based on policy config)
    # Example: If policy allows only docker.io and gcr.io, this would violate:
    image: evil-registry.example.com/busybox:1.36
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'sleep 3600']
