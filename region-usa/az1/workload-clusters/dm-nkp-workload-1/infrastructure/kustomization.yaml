# Infrastructure components for dm-nkp-workload-1
# These are deployed INSIDE the workload cluster

resources:
  # Base infrastructure (includes sealed-secrets-controller)
  - ../../_base/infrastructure/

# NOTE: NDK image pull secrets are now deployed via ClusterResourceSet
# from the management cluster. See:
# region-usa/az1/management-cluster/workspaces/dm-dev-workspace/clusters/cluster-resource-sets/

# Add infrastructure components as needed, e.g.:
#   - cert-manager/
#   - ingress-nginx/
#   - external-dns/
#   - external-secrets/
